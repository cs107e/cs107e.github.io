## Parts kit
Each student is given a CS107e parts kit containing the materials needed for the course assignments and labs. The parts kit contains:
- a __Raspberry Pi A+__ <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-a-plus/>
- a __MicroSDHC card__ <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002533302780.html>
    + need only tiny capacity (< 1GB), we buy minimum size we can find
    + be sure manufacturer has known good quality control (cheap unreliable cards are no bargain)
- a __CP2102 USB-to-serial__ breakout board <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/cp2102-serial-converter-usb-2-0-to-ttl-uart-ftdi.html>
- a full-sized __breadboard__ <https://www.jameco.com/z/WBU-202-R-Jameco-Valuepro-830-Point-Solderless-Breadboard-6-5-x-2-125-_20723.html>
    + Jameco is solid! (cheaper breadboards can have flaky connection points)
- __jumpers__ (5-25 of each kind) <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32891879068.html>
    -  __female-female__ (short, 10cm) and (long, 20cm)
    -  __female-male__ (long, 20cm)
    -  __male-male__ jumpers, various lengths
- a __mini-box__ containing these small components:
    - __resistors__ ([how resistance is encoded in band color](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors#decoding-resistor-markings),  [color code calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code))
        - twenty __1K resistors__ (for leds, 4-digit display, transistors) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1k-ohm-1-2w-5-carbon-film-resistor.html>
        - four __10K resistors__ (for push buttons) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10k-ohm-1-2w-5-carbon-film-resistor.html>
    - eight __LEDs__ <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=led+5mm+ultra+bright>
    - a 4-digit __7-segment display__ (common cathode) <http://www.lanpade.com/7-segment-led-dot-matrix/5461as.html>
    - four tactile __pushbuttons__ <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/tact-switch-12-12mm-7-3mm-through-hole-spst-no-4-pins.html>
    - four __caps__ for the pushbuttons (we give 1 each of 4 different colors): [blue](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/round-tactile-push-button-cap-blue-color.html), [yellow](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/round-tactile-push-button-cap-yellow-color.html), [red](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/round-tactile-push-button-cap-red-color.html), [green](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/round-tactile-push-button-cap-green-color.html)
    - four 2N3904 __transistors__ (BJTs) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/2n3904-npn-general-propose-transistor.html>
    - mini __claw clips__ (for cable management) <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089R9R8MH>
{% comment %}
    - a USB MicroSD __card reader__ <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002286511762.html>
    - a 2-4 pin __header strip__ <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/40-pin-2-54-mm-single-row-pin-header-strip.html>
{% endcomment %}


## Lab tools supplement
Doing the labs also requires a few hand tools and supplies, which will have available for use in the lab room.

Hand tools and supplies for breadboarding:

- wire __stripper__, needlenose __pliers__, and angled __cutter__
    (recommendations in our [guide to hand tools](/guides/handtools))
- solid core __wire__, 22-24 AWG

For keyboard lab:

- PS/2 __keyboard__ and __mouse__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BF15X>
-  inexpensive, low-speed USB __logic analyzer__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077LSG5P2>
- PS/2 breakout board (optional)
    + we source a custom board from <https://www.pcbway.com/>
    + other options from Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/product/804> or Digikey <https://www.digikey.com/short/ptjt5f4b>
    + can simply wire jumpers directly into keyboard plug (we did this for years and it works fine)

For graphics lab:
- any __display__ (monitor, tv, projector) that accepts HDMI input
- __HDMI cable__



## Sources for parts

We have found that parts from [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) are a good value, especially when purchasing in bulk, although it will take a few weeks to arrive.

We often purchase the boxes from [Daiso](https://www.daisojapan.com/) because their
physical stores have very good quality boxes for very cheap.

If looking to buy parts for your personal use, we also recommend [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/), [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), and [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) for their high-quality products and excellent customer service.
