## Parts kit
Each student is given a parts kit containing the materials needed for the course assignments and labs. The kit is packed into a plastic box and contains:
- a flamingo pink __Mango Pi MQ-Pro__ <https://widora.cn/mqpro>
- a short __USB-C extension cable with on/off switch__ <https://a.co/d/1LONjaU>
- a slim __USB-C hub/splitter__ <https://a.co/d/c7Pl74S>
- a __USB OTG connector__ <https://a.co/d/a9yR0XI>
- a __CP2102 USB-to-serial__ breakout board <https://a.co/d/fbcCC3o>
- a full-sized __breadboard__ <https://www.jameco.com/z/239-Adafruit-Industries-Full-Sized-Premium-Breadboard-830-Tie-Points_2500655.html>
    + Jameco, BusBoard, Velleman are solid! sometimes cheaper breadboards have flaky connection points, best to avoid
- __jumpers__ (5-20 of each) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=dupont+jumper+female>
    -  __female-female__
    -  __female-male__
- a handy __reference card__ (Anna Mistele's [custom design](/guides/refcard))
- a __mini-box__ of small components:
    - a 4-digit __7-segment display__ <http://www.lanpade.com/7-segment-led-dot-matrix/5461as.html>
    - __resistors__ ([how resistance is encoded in band color](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors#decoding-resistor-markings),  [color code calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code))
        - twenty __1K resistors__ (for leds, 4-digit display, transistors) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1k-ohm-1-2w-5-carbon-film-resistor.html>
        - four __10K resistors__ (for push buttons) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10k-ohm-1-2w-5-carbon-film-resistor.html>
    - eight __LEDs__ <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=led+5mm+ultra+bright>
    - four 2N3904 __transistors__ (BJTs) <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/2n3904-npn-general-propose-transistor.html>
    - tactile __pushbuttons__ and colored button __caps__ <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/tact-switch-12-12mm-7-3mm-through-hole-spst-no-4-pins.html> <https://www.taydaelectronics.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=tactile+switch+caps>
    - mini __claw clips__ (for cable management) <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TWN8DQZ>


## Lab tools supplement
The lab activities require some additional hand tools and supplies which will have available for use in the lab room.

Hand tools and supplies for breadboarding:

- wire __stripper__, needlenose __pliers__, and angled __cutter__
    - if you interested in purchasing your own tools, see recommendations in our [guide to hand tools](/guides/handtools)
- solid core __wire__, 22-24 AWG
-  __male-male__ jumpers, various lengths
- multimeter

For keyboard lab:

- PS/2 __keyboard__ and __mouse__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758BF15X> <https://a.co/d/7j11KRC>
-  inexpensive, low-speed USB __logic analyzer__ <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077LSG5P2>
- __PS/2 breakout__ board
    + we source a custom board from <https://www.pcbway.com/>
    + other options from Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/product/804> or Digikey <https://www.digikey.com/short/ptjt5f4b>
    + can simply wire jumpers directly into keyboard plug (we did this for years and it works fine)

For graphics lab:
- any __display__ (monitor, tv, projector) that accepts HDMI input
- __HDMI cable__ (Mango Pi has a mini-HDMI connector so need compatible cable or adapter)

## Sources for parts

We have found that parts from [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) are a good value, especially when purchasing in bulk, although it will take a few weeks to arrive. Ordering from the [Ali Express](https://www.aliexpress.com/) marketplace can be even more economical, but customer service and quality can vary by individual seller -- buyer beware!

We often purchase boxes from [Daiso](https://www.daisojapan.com/) because their
physical stores have very good quality boxes that are quite reasonably priced.

If looking to buy parts for your personal use, we also recommend [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/), [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), and [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) for their high-quality products and excellent customer service.
