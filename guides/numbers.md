title: Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers
---

Everyone is familiar with decimal numbers. However, with computers it is often
much more convenient to work with binary and hexadecimal numbers. We also need
to learn how to deal with bits, and bitwise operators.

Do you know the answers to the following questions?

  1. What is the decimal value of 0b1000?
  2. What is 255 in hexadecimal?
  3. What is 0xA in binary?
  4. What are the minimum numbers of bits needed to store the number 8?
  5. What does 0b01 + 0b10 equal?
  6. What is 0x01 AND 0x02? 0x01 OR 0x2? 0x01 EOR (XOR) 0x02?
  7. What is the value of 0x01 bitwise shifted left by 2?

If you don't know the answers to these questions, we recommend that you review
the following material.
