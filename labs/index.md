### Lab FAQ

*Written by Julie Zelenski, modified for CS107E by Pat Hanrahan*

**What is a lab?**

Each student **must** participate in a weekly 2-hour lab section 
that focuses on active hands-on experimentation and practical skill-building.
In lab, you will work on a set of exercises/tasks that reinforce 
the week's material.
When you leave the lab, you should be well-prepared
to do the assignment for that week.
Instructors and CAs will be available during the labs.

The labs will often involve hardware.
For example, in the first lab you will learn 
how to create a circuit on a breadboard.
We will bring tools and supplies to the labs. 

**How is lab credit awarded?**

Labs are graded for participation on a credit/no-credit basis.
To earn credit,
you need to arrive on-time and actively participate for the full lab period.
We are hopeful the lab period will be enough time to work through all exercises,
but what you don't finish, we encourage you to complete on your own.
At the end of the lab period,
you submit your checkoff sheet to the lab leader 
so your participation can be recorded.
When turning in a checkoff sheet,
you are asserting that you (and any partner named)
fully participated in the lab.
It is considered a violation of the Honor Code 
to misrepresent your or a peer's participation.

**What is the lab collaboration policy?**

More heads are better than one for this kind of experimenting,
so you will work in **pairs.** 
You are also encouraged to discuss the work 
and share ideas with others in your lab room.
Lab time is for active, hands-on, collaborative learning 
-- please offer your help to your peers 
and seek advice from your peers and the staff.
The goal is for everyone to come away 
with a clear understanding of the lab concepts 
and be prepared to go on to complete the assignments 
(which are done individually).

**Is it okay to arrive to lab late or leave early?**

We award credit for labs based on participation and effort.
We expect you to arrive on-time and participate for the full lab period 
(or until satisfactorily completing all lab exercises).
We won't quibble about few minutes here or there but beyond that,
arriving late or skipping out early will result in not receiving lab credit.

**What happens if I miss my lab?**

If you do have to miss attending your lab session one week, 
please come to the other session if possible. If you 
miss a lab entirely,
you must still complete the exercises on your own.

Many of the labs go over material for that weeks assignment. 
If you miss a lab, you may have trouble doing the assignment.
