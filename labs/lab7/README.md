### Interrupts

#### 1) Review interrupt assembly

In the first lecture on interrupts, we went over the low-level mechanisms. The `interrupts` module is used to configure interrupts and manage handlers at a global level. The module interface is documented in [interrupts.h](/header#interrupts) and its implementation is split into the files [interrupts.c](/src#interrupts) (C code) and [interrupts_asm.s](/src#interrupts_asm) (assembly). These source files are available in the directory `$CS107E/src`.

Start by reviewing the `interrupts_asm.s` file which contains the assembly portion of the `interrupts` module implementation.  Here is a roadmap to the functions:

- `interrupts_global_disable` and `interrupts_global_enable`
    - set/clear machine-mode interrupt bits in the `mstatus` and `mie` CSRs.
- `interrupts_get_mepc` and others
    - retrieve CSR values that are needed by the interrupts module
-  `interrupts_set_mtvec`
    - sets the address of the function to execute on a trap

These functions have to be written in assembly because the CSRs can only be accessed by the special `csr` assembly instructions.

The `interrupts_set_mtvec` sets the function pointer that will be called to service a trap. The trap function should be declared `__attribute__((interrupt("machine")))`. Review the [gcc documentation on function attributes](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RISC-V-Function-Attributes.html) to learn more. The `interrupt` attribute changes the function's assembly to include a prolog and epilog that safely enter and exit interrupt processing.

Open <https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/fPGdz4MPP> in your browser; this is a Compiler Explorer example that shows an ordinary function and three trap functions declared with the `interrupt` attribute. Look carefully the generated assembly for the trap functions to see what is different.

+ When a function completes, where does control flow resume?
    - An ordinary function ends with `ret`, which resumes execution in the caller at the instruction after the call. The address of that instruction is stored in the register `ra` ("return address").
    - A trap function instead ends with an `mret` instruction, which resumes execution at the interrupted instruction. The address of that instruction is stored in the CSR `mepc` ("machine exception program counter").
    - Talk this over with your tablemates to understand the similarities and differences. Why two distinct mechanisms; why is it not possible to use same for both?

+ The three trap functions differ in which registers are saved to the stack on entry and restored on exit.
    - `trap_A` spills no registers
    - `trap_B` spills `a4` and `a5`
    - `trap_C` spills half of all 32 general-purpose registers `ra`, `t0`-`t6`, and `a0`-`a7`
    - Why the difference in which registers are being saved? Why those specific registers are not others?

+ How does the memory being used for the stack frame for the trap function relate to the stack memory being used by the ordinary functions?
    - If you were to call `backtrace_gather_frames()` from within the trap function, what would the backtrace look like?

You're ready for this check-in question[^1].


#### 2) Review interrupt dispatch

The C code in `interrupts.c` implements the bulk of the `interrupts` module.  Start by reviewing the implementation of the `trap_handler` function. This trap function is installed using `interrupts_set_mtvec` and will be called for every trap. If the trap was due to an external interrupt, it dispatches to the registered handler. All other trap causes are an unrecoverable fatal exception, so the functions prints an error message and exits with `mango_abort`.

In our second lecture on interrupts, we reviewed the design that dispatches an event to its associated handler function. The design for dispatch in both `interrupts` and `gpio_interrupt` uses an array of function pointers, one per-index. The client who wants to use interrupts implements a handler function and registers it with the dispatcher. The dispatcher stores the client's function pointer in the array at the associated index. When an event occurs, the dispatch invokes the handler function at that index. In the top-level `interrupts` module, the interrupt source number is the index into the array of handlers. In the `gpio_interrupt` module, the pin index within the gpio group is used as the index.

There is a neat performance trick that applies here. To identify which gpio pin has a pending event, the dispatcher scans the status registers to find the first bit that is set. If you were implementing that scan in C, you might loop and shift/test each bit individually. A more streamlined version could do fancy bit twiddling, such as [Kernighan's bit count](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12380478) algorithm, or employ on a lookup table. Such versions might take tens or even hundreds of cycles.

A better way to implement is to drop down to assembly and leverage bitwise tricks to count leading zeros. We are using the hand-rolled assembly provided by gcc in software (`__builtin_clz`). Enthusiastic hackers compete to see if they can [outperform it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/132s19s/hand_optimised_riscv_assembly_language_clz/).  The recently ratified RISC-V [Zbb extension](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11-dKxnp7yfl9L3HESXGCtYl90dFKGTzE/view) adds a `clz` (count leading zeros) instruction that counts in as few as 3 cycles. (Sadly, the C906 processor in the Mango Pi predates this extension...).  Reducing the time it takes to find a pending interrupt from 100 to 3 cycles, (an improvement of 33x!) is a big benefit to every single interrupt.  This kind of throughput boost is why instructions like `clz` exist. Neat!

Test your understanding of interrupt dispatch by reviewing these questions and check in with us [^2]

+ How is a function "registered" as a handler with a dispatcher? How does the dispatcher know which handler to call for a given event? Can there be multiple handlers registered for the same event? If there is no handler registered for a pending event, what will the dispatcher do with the event?
+ An `aux_data` pointer can be stored with the handler. That pointer is later passed as an argument to the handler when invoked. What is the purpose of an `aux_data` pointer?

#### 3) Set up a button circuit

Let's execute some code that uses interrupts. Set up a one-button circuit on your breadboard. Connect one side of the button to gpio PB4 and the other side to ground. Connect your Pi to a HDMI monitor.

![button circuit](images/button-circuit.jpg){: .zoom -w-50}

Back in Assignment 2, we put a hardware resistor in the button circuit to set default state. This time, the code activates the internal pull-up instead. When the button is not pressed, the internal resistor "pulls up" the value to 1.  When the button is pressed, it closes the circuit and connects the pin to ground. The value then reads as 0.

Review the code in `lab7/button/button.c`. In the starting version, `main` function sits in a loop that calls `wait_for_click` and then redraws the screen.

Fill in the implementation of the empty `wait_for_click` function to operate by _polling_. It should:

+ Wait for a falling edge on the button gpio, i.e. repeatedly call `gpio_read()` until observe a transition from 1 to 0.
+ After observe falling edge, increment the `gCount` global variable and announce with `uart_putstring("click!")`

Compile and run the program. The program sits and waits for you to click the button. When you do, the message is printed and the screen redraws to show the incremented count. This version of the program is always redrawing or waiting for a click, but it's either one or the other. While waiting for a button press, the screen redraw is paused. While redrawing the screen, no button presses are detected. Ideally, we want the program to do both tasks concurrently.

- If you click the button multiple times in quick succession, some of
the presses are missed. You get neither a printed message nor a screen
redraw and these clicks are not included in the count. Why does that happen?

You'll note that redrawing the screen is quite slow. If we were to speed up the drawing, it would cause us to miss fewer events, but it doesn't fundamentally solve the problem. Interrupts are the better solution!

#### 4) Write a button handler

Remove the call to `wait_for_click` from the loop in `main`. Compile and re-run. The program now repeatedly redraws the screen.  If you click the button, there is no response. The program never calls `wait_for_click` and won't observe any change in the GPIO pin, it's 100% occupied with drawing.

You are now going to rework the program to process those button clicks as interrupts.

Start by reviewing the documentation for the library modules you will use:
+ [gpio_interrupt.h](/header#gpio_interrupt)
    * Gpio interrupts module
+ [interrupts.h](/header#interrupts)
    * Top-level interrupts module

There are multiple steps to set up an interrupt and coordination is across two modules: `gpio_interrupt` for gpio-specific configuration and top-level `interrupts` module for global state.

- Edit code in `config_button()` to set up gpio interrupts for button click events following the steps below. Setting up gpio_interrupts should be done _after_ setting the button to input and activating the pull-up resistor.
    + call `gpio_interrupt_init()` to initialize the gpio interrupt module
    + call `gpio_interrupt_config()` to configure the button event trigger
        - You want a trigger on falling edge (negative edge) events on the button gpio. Set `debounce` to true.
    + define a handler function for the button event
        + The function prototype is of the form `void handle_click(void *aux_data)`. We are not using the `aux_data` argument in this version, but prototype must exactly match the standard handler prototype nonetheless.
        + Be sure that your handler clears the event!
        +  The handler function increments `gCount` and outputs a message `uart_putstring("[YOUR-NAME-HERE] has interrupt mojo!")`
    + call `gpio_interrupt_register_handler()` to register your handler function for button events
        + Pass `NULL` for `aux_data`; the handler does not use the argument.
    + call `gpio_interrupt_enable` to enable the button interrupt
- Edit code in `main()` to set up global interrupts
    + call `interrupts_init` to initialize the global interrupt system (do this once at very start of program)
    + call `interrupts_global_enable()` to turn on the "global switch" (final step, after all pieces configured and ready)

The order that you do these operations is important: think
carefully about each action, revisiting the lecture slides/code if
you need to.  Talk this over with your tablemates and ensure that you
understand what each step does and why it's necessary.

Compile and run the program. If you have done everything correctly, the program continuously redraws as before, but now whenever you click the button, it prints a message in your terminal to congratulate your prowess with interrupts and the click count increments. You get the best of both worlds: your long-running computation can be written as a simple loop, yet the system is immediately responsive to input.

Once you have it working, go back and intentionally make various errors, such as doing steps out of order, forgetting a step, or doing a step twice.  Seeing the observed consequences of these mistakes now may help you to identify them in the future.

Some things to try:
- What error results if you try to register a gpio interrupt handler before initializing the gpio interrupts module?
- What error results if you try to init the interrupts module more than once?
- What error results if the interrupt handler does not clear the event?
- What changes if you set `debounce` to false when configuring the button event?

Change the code back to the correct configuration before moving on.

You're ready for another check-in question[^3].

#### 5) Coordinate between main and interrupt

You want to change the program to redraw once in response to each button click and otherwise wait quietly rather than continuously redraw. This requires that the interrupt and main code share state.

Edit the code within the loop in `main` to only call `redraw` if the count of clicks has incremented past the last redraw, i.e. `gCount` is larger than the count stored in local variable `drawn`.

The count of clicks is stored in the global variable `gCount`. The handler increments it and the `main` reads the value and compares to saved count.  `gCount` is not currently declared `volatile`. Should it be? Why or why not?  Can the compiler tell, by looking at only this file, how control flows between main and the interrupt handler? Will the compiler generate different code if `volatile` than without it? Will the program behave differently? Test it both ways to confirm what (if any) is the consequence of not declaring the `gCount` variable as `volatile`. You are ready to answer this check-in question[^4].

#### 6) Use a ring buffer queue

Watch carefully as the program executes and you'll note that every click is detected and counted, but the count of redraw iterations is not one-to-one with those updates. Multiple clicks can occur while the program is occupied in `redraw` before the `main` loop gets around to next checking the value of `gCount`.

To track all updates and process each one by one, we can use a ring buffer queue to communicate updates from the interrupt handler and `main`. The handler function will enqueue each update to the ring buffer and `main` will dequeue each update . Because the queue stores every individual update posted by the interrupt handler, we can be sure that we never miss one.

How to rework the code:

- Review the [ringbuffer.h](/header#ringbuffer) header file and source file [ringbuffer.c](/src#ringbuffer) to see the provided ring buffer queue. This ADT maintains a queue of integer values implemented as a ring buffer.
- In the `main` function, declare a variable of type `rb_t *rb` and initialize with a call to `rb_new`.
- When calling `gpio_interrupt_register_handler`, change to pass the `rb` pointer as `aux_data.`
- Change your click handler function to receive `rb` pointer as `aux_data`, i.e. cast the `aux_data` to `rb_t *`. Add the updated value of `gCount` to the ring buffer by calling `rb_enqueue`.
- Edit `main` to use `rb_dequeue` to retrieve each update from the queue. Remove the previous code comparing `gCount` to saved count and instead check if the ring buffer is non-empty to detect there is a pending update to draw.

Make the above changes and rebuild and run the program. It should now redraw the screen once for each button press in one-to-one correspondence, including patiently processing a backlog of individual redraws from each click in a fast sequence.

When you're done, take a moment to verify your understanding:

- With this change, is it no longer necessary for `gCount` to be declared `volatile`, not does it need to be global (i.e. could declare as static within the handler function). The ring buffer is also not a global variable; we use `aux_data` to pass it from main to the interrupt handler. What is the benefit to limiting scope and visibility versus a global variable?
- The clever design of the ring buffer provides safe concurrent access for one reader and one writer.  Review the code in `rb_enqueue` and `rb_dequeue`. Trace what happens if execution is midway through `rb_dequeue` when an interrupt fires and the handler function makes a call to `rb_enqueue`. Confirm that the updates to the ring buffer from enqueueing the element won't cause problems for the dequeue operation when it resumes.
- Why might you want the handler to enqueue an update and return instead of doing the actual task (e.g. redraw) directly in the handler?

You're ready for the final check-in question [^5].

### Project brainstorm and team speed-dating

Visit our [project gallery](/project_gallery/) to see a sampling of projects
from our past students. We are __so so proud__ of the creations of our past
students -- impressive, inventive, and fun! You'll get started in earnest on
the project next week, but we set aside a little time in this week's lab for a
group discussion to preview the general guidelines and spark your creativity
about possible directions you could take in your project. If you have questions
about the project arrangements or are curious about any of our past projects,
please ask us for more info, we love to talk about the neat work we've seen our
students do. If you have ideas already fomenting, share with the group to find
synergy and connect with possible teammates. Project teams are most typically
pairs, although occasionally we have allowed solo or trios by special request.
