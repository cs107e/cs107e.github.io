title: Keyboards and the PS/2 Protocol
readings: |
    Prof. Chris Gregg will lead a lecture on all things keyboard: the venerable P2S/2 protocol plus bonus excursions into Midi protocol and controlling an old-school typewriter!

    Readings:
    - Read Adam Chapweske's overview of the [PS/2 protocol](https://web.archive.org/web/20180302005138/http://computer-engineering.org/ps2protocol/) for keyboards and mice.
    - Neat video from Ben Eater demonstrating how to read PS/2 scancode via [breadboard wizardry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aXbh9VUB3U). He does it all in hardware, thankfully easier for us in software!
