Need to consider master -vs- slave mode: on pages 647-648, there is possibly conflicting information:

page 647:
- When the I2S works in the master mode, the external I2S module provides BCLK_in and LRCK_in for the
clock management unit (CMU), and the I2S_TX and I2S_RX work with the two external clocks.
- When the I2S works in the slave mode, the CMU provides clocks BCLK_out and LRCK_out for the external
I2S module, and the I2S_TX and I2S_RX work with the internal clocks.

But, on page 648:
LRCK and BCLK are bidirectional I/O. When the I2S/PCM interface works in the Master mode, LRCK and BCLK
are output pins. When the I2S/PCM interface works in the Slave mode, LRCK and BCLK are input pins.

This seems to conflict -- if the external device is providing the clocks, they need to be input pins, not output pins. My hunch is that page 647 is backwards.

"The integrated PLL on the device removes the requirement for a system clock (commonly known as master clock), allowing a 3-wire I2S connection and reducing system EMI."
