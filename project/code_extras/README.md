This code_extras folder contains a hodgepodge of additional code resources. We have drivers written for some of common peripherals, various bits of sample code, and a few contributions shared by former students. You are welcome to incorporate any of this code into your project with proper citation. If you extend the code or add bug fixes, please contribute those modifications back to us for all to share!

- `spi` and `i2c`
    - these drivers have been successfully used in past, minor recent updates to code
- `pwm` and `i2s`
    - code for these modules is new-ish and needs further testing
- `math_lib`: student's implementation of math functions
- `neopixel`: sample code for Neopixel/WS8212 rgb led
