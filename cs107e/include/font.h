/*
 * This module provides a font. Each ASCII character has an
 * associated glyph. A glyph is a bitmap image for drawing
 * the character.
 *
 * The font is fixed width; every glyph has the same width and
 * same height. A glyph is an image with font_get_glyph_height() rows
 * and font_get_glyph_width() columns.
 * Each pixel of the glyph image is represented as one byte.
 * The byte for an "on" pixel is 0xFF, and the byte for
 * "off" pixel is 0x00.
 *
 * Students do not implement this module: the source code for
 * its implementation is provided as part of assignment 6.
